## Project Architecture

OpenMeet Platform is built with:
- **[Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/)**: A Vue.js based framework for building responsive web applications
- **[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)**: Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
- **[Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)**: State management for Vue applications
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Typed JavaScript for better developer experience
- **[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)**: End-to-end and component testing
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)**: Unit testing framework

The project follows a modular architecture with:
- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages`: Application pages and routes
- `/src/layouts`: Page layouts and structure
- `/src/stores`: Pinia state management
- `/src/boot`: Application initialization and plugins
- `/src/api`: API service integrations
- `/src/composables`: Reusable Vue composition functions
- `/src/utils`: Utility functions
- `/src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/i18n`: Internationalization resources
