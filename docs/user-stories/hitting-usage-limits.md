# Hitting Usage Limits

As a user I use resources on openmeet.net, such as time spent searching, the number of messages sent, or the number of groups or events I've created.
Using the free tier, I can only use so many of these resources before I hit a limit.
Once I hit a limit, I can no longer use those resources until the next billing period, or I upgrade to a paid plan and cover the cost of the resources consumed.

## 1. How do I know what my limits are?

I will recieve an message from the system if I've exceeded my limits.
I can see in my profile page how many resources I've used and how many I have left before hitting a limit.

## 2. What happens if I hit a limit?

I will no longer be able to use the resource that I've hit the limit for.
If I continue to use the resource, I will be blocked from doing so.

## 3. How do I upgrade my plan?

I can upgrade my plan by clicking on "manage subscription" in my profile page and selecting the plan I want to upgrade to.

## 4. What happens to unused resources?

Unused resources are not carried over to the next billing period.
