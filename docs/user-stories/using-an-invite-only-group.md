# Using an Invite-Only Group v1

## 1. Creating an Invite-Only Group

1. When creating a group, select "People you invite" from the dropdown for "Group Visibility".

2. This means that only the members you invite will be able to see or join the group.  
3. This group won't show up during searches or as recommendations to other users.
4. The only way to join this group is if you have been invited by a member of the group.

## 2. Social Site Sharing an Invite-Only Group

1. On the group page, there is usually a button for sharing the group info to social media.
2. This button doesn't make sense for invite-only groups because even having the link to the group page won't help you join the group.
3. For non-invite-only groups, this button allows you to share the group with others so they can see details and join.

## 3. Inviting Members to an Invite-Only Group

1. As an administrator, and maybe as a moderator, I can invite a user to the group by entering their email address, or by sharing with them an invitation link from the group settings page.
2. The link has an expiration date and can be revoked.

## 4. Joining an Invite-Only Group

1. As a user, I've received an invite link or QR code for the link from an administrator of an invite-only group.
2. I click on the link and am redirected to the OpenMeet page for the group, where I can see details of the group, plus a join button.
3. After clicking the join button, I receive a notification via email that I've been invited to the group and am awaiting vetting.
4. Once an admin or moderator approves my membership, I get a notification that I'm a member of the group, and I can now participate in group activities.
